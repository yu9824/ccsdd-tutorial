This is a sample blog post. It demonstrates the content convention: posts live in `posts/` as Markdown files with optional YAML front matter.

## Creating and updating posts

- **Create a new post**: Add a new `.md` file under `posts/` with front matter (e.g. `title`, `date`, `slug`) and a body. After the next build and deploy, it will appear in the post listing and at its stable URL.
- **Update a post**: Edit the existing file — change the title, date, slug, or body. The next successful build will reflect your changes on the site.

No CMS or database is required; the repository is the source of truth. Standard Markdown syntax is supported in the body.
